# UIkit_Lightbox_Extended
**UIkit lightbox extended functionality**

This project was made as a result of a work I did for one of my clients.
The task was to make a gallery, masonry style with filters and ability that related items could be shown in modal box.

Since it turned out that the task was not completely trivial I eventually decided to publish the project and make 
it available for anyone who may find it useful.

**Example**

The best way to see how UIlit lightbox extended works is to browse the example folder and see it's files and structure.

Download zip file, unpack it and upload the 'example' folder to your PHP enabled server (php 5.4.x or higher). Once it
 is finished point your browser to the 'example' folder, e.g. yourdomain/example, and you should see the gallery example.
